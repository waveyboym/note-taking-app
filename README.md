link to quick run of the app: https://onlinegdb.com/msYmc8LNz (click the run button in order to run the file)

please note:
1. I am still working on the search function and the edit function
2. For now you can only add new notes, open the notes by clicking on the note boxes, write text in the note boxes and then either cancel or save changes
